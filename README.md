## Introduction
Pronto is an efficient, versatile and modular EKF state estimator for both
proprioceptive (inertial, kinematics) and exteroceptive (LIDAR, camera) sensor
fusion.  It has been used with a variety of inputs from sensors such as IMUs
(Microstrain, KVH, XSense), LIDAR (Hokuyo, Velodyne), cameras
(Carnegie Robotics Multisense SL, Intel RealSense) and joint
kinematics.

### Legged Robots
Pronto provided the state estimate that was used by MIT DRC team in the
DARPA Robotics Challenge to estimate the position and motion of the Boston
Dynamics Atlas robot.

Since then, it has been adapted to estimate the motion of the NASA Valkyrie robot at
the University of Edinburgh, the HyQ quadruped robot at the Istituto Italiano di
Tecnologia, and the ANYmal quadruped robot at the University of Oxford.

### Micro Aerial Vehicles
Pronto was originally developed for Micro Aerial Vehicle state
estimation. The modules specific to MAVs (e.g., altimeter, GPS) are not currently supported.

## Software Overview
The algorithms (and their ROS wrappers) are written in C/C++ and organized as
`catkin` packages.
The repository consists of the following main modules:

- `pronto_core`: core libraries that implment the filter, the state and
basic measurement modules (e.g., IMU, pose update)
- `pronto_biped` leg odometry measurement modules for humanoid robots (tested
on Atlas and Valkyrie)
- `pronto_quadruped` leg odometry libraries for a quadruped robot (tested on
HyQ and ANYmal)
- `pronto_quadruped_commons` abstract interfaces to perform leg odometry on a
quadruped robot. This is a fork of the `iit_commons` package (see
[here](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/iit_commons)).
- `*_ros` ROS wrappers of the above modules
- other support packages for filtering

## Dependencies
Pronto depends on Eigen and Boost

## System Requirements
The target operating system is **Ubuntu 20.04** equipped with **ROS Noetic**.  
 Other versions of Ubuntu/ROS might work but they are **not** actively supported or tested.

## Building the Code
Pronto is organized as a collection of catkin packages. To build the code,
just run `catkin build` followed by the name of the packages you are 
interested to build.

## Robot Implementation Example
To learn how to use Pronto on your robot, you can have a look at the [examples folder](https://github.com/ori-drs/pronto/examples), which contains a full implementation for the ANYmal B quadruped robot.
