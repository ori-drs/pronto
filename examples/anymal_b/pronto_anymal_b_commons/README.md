This packages contains the implementation for the ANYmal robot of the interfaces developed at the 
Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia for a generic quadruped robot with 12 DoF (a.k.a. the dog interfaces, hence `iit::dog`).

The interfaces provide a level of abstraction to command/estimate the behavior of a generic quadruped robot, regardless of its specific 
kinematic or dynamic parameters.

This implementation allows to run on ANYmal all the code which depends on these interfaces.
